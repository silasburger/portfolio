After growing up in Berkeley I spent six years living in Burlington (Vermont), Buenos Aires, Dublin, and Boston. I'm also very excited to have recently obtained Irish citizenship. Since leaving my job in Boston I have taken every opportunity to become a software engineer from moving back home to Berkeley to spending long days learning the technologies that inspire me. I hope to use everything that I have learned along my path to contribute to a codebase that can change the world we live in for the better.
