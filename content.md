#About me
After growing up in Berkeley I spent six years living in Burlington (Vermont), Buenos Aires, Dublin, and Boston. I'm also very excited to have recently obtained Irish citizenship. Since leaving my job in Boston I have taken every opportunity to become a software engineer from moving back home to Berkeley to spending long days learning the technologies that inspire me. I hope to use everything that I have learned along my path to contribute to a codebase that can change the world we live in for the better.

#Course Report
Built proxy-server to retrieve school and blog data from Course Report for use with a new mobile app. The react native app allows users to read about and contact schools as well as browse blog articles.

#Microblog
I built the frontend using Redux, React, and Bootstrap. Users can write, edit, comment, and vote. Posts are ranked on the frontpage of the site. The primary focus of this project was to design a heirarchy that connects components to Redux in a strategic and thoughtful manner.

#Jobly
A job search web app with complete with search functionality and authentication. I built both the frontend and backend using PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Bootstrap.

#React Snake
This project taught me about the rules of react (don't duplicate keys) and allowed me to exercise my knowledge of the react lifecycle to build my take on the classic arcade game. The snake gets faster as it grows!
