#About me
I grew up in the Bay Area, went to school in Vermont, and worked at a marketing agency in Boston for two years before returning home to attend code school in San Francisco. I am primarily a fullstack JS developer, but I have experience working on Flask and Rails as well as mobile with React Native. The language I'm most excited to learn is Rust because of WASM.

<!--After growing up in Berkeley I spent six years living in Burlington (Vermont), Buenos Aires, Dublin, and Boston. I'm also very excited to have recently obtained Irish citizenship. Since leaving my job in Boston I have taken every opportunity to become a software engineer from moving back home to Berkeley to spending long days learning the technologies that inspire me. I hope to use everything that I have learned along my path to contribute to a codebase that can change the world we live in for the better.

#Course Report
As part of my internship at Course Report I helped build an MVP mobile app that allows users to read blog articles and view/contact schools. The project leveraged an Express proxy server to periodically retrieve school and blog data from the core rails server, store it in a redis cache, and serve it to the mobile app using RESTful standards. The app features auto-pagination while scrolling, fuzzy search, and sort by location functionality.


#Microblog
I built the frontend using Redux, React, and Bootstrap. Users can write, edit, comment, and vote. Posts are ranked on the frontpage of the site. The primary focus of this project was to design a heirarchy that connects components to Redux in a strategic and thoughtful manner. An interesting part of this project was using the combineReducers Redux feature to separate reducers for different objects in the store.

#Jobly
A job search site with authentication and search functionality. I implemented RESTful APIs for User, Job, and Company resources with Express and used PostgreSQL as the database. The frontend uses 

I built both the frontend and backend using PostgreSQL, Express, React, and Bootstrap.

Implemented and tested RESTful APIs for User, Job, and Company resources. Added authorization and validation middleware to routes. Created React frontend that allows users to search for companies/jobs and apply for jobs.

#React Snake
I exercised my knowledge of the React lifecycle to build my take on the classic arcade game. The snake gets faster as it grows!

While making the game I ran into a number of React specific problems that I had to overcome. For example, elements with duplicate keys dropping from the virtual DOM. 

#Warbler
I Built server-side rendered Twitter clone in Flask. This project taught me how to build a site with no frontend, relying on server-side templating and HTML responses. Working with Flask, I learned about auth patterns, the concept of a global user, and sessions.
